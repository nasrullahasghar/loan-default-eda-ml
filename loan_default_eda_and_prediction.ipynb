📈 Skewness Analysis — Detecting Data Imbalance in Disguise\n\nBefore we move deeper, let’s check how “balanced” or “tilted” our numeric features are.  \nSkewness helps us understand whether most data points lie on one side of the mean.  \nA skewness of **0** means symmetry, while values above **1** or below **–1** indicate strong skew.\n\n| Feature | Skewness | Interpretation |\n|----------|-----------|----------------|\n| `ID` | 0.00 | Uniformly distributed — purely an identifier. |\n| `year` | 0.00 | Constant across all entries (only 2019). |\n| `loan_amount` | 1.67 | **Right-skewed** — many small loans, few very large ones. |\n| `rate_of_interest` | 0.39 | Slightly **right-skewed** — mostly centered near average rates. |\n| `Interest_rate_spread` | 0.28 | Fairly **symmetric**, minimal distortion. |\n| `Upfront_charges` | 1.75 | **Highly right-skewed** — most borrowers pay small fees, some pay huge amounts. |\n| `term` | -2.17 | **Left-skewed** — most loans are long-term, few are short-term. |\n| `property_value` | 4.59 | **Extremely right-skewed** — a few high-value properties stretch the scale. |\n| `income` | 17.31 | **Severely right-skewed** — large income disparity among borrowers. |\n| `Credit_Score` | 0.00 | **Balanced** — most borrowers have mid-range scores. |\n| `LTV` | 120.62 | **Extremely right-skewed** — possibly contains outliers or errors. |\n| `Status` | 1.18 | **Right-skewed** — far fewer defaults than successful loans. |\n| `dtir1` | -0.55 | Slight **left skew**, fairly stable distribution. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Observations\n\n- Most **financial variables** (`loan_amount`, `income`, `Upfront_charges`, `property_value`, `LTV`) show **strong right skewness**, indicating a few extreme high-value cases.  \n- **LTV** and **income** have *very high skewness* — they may need **log transformation** to stabilize model performance later.  \n- **Term** and **dtir1** are slightly **left-skewed**, meaning most loans have longer durations and moderate debt ratios.  \n- **Rate-related features** (`rate_of_interest`, `Interest_rate_spread`) are nicely balanced — good signs for numerical stability.  \n- The **target `Status`** is slightly right-skewed, confirming **class imbalance** (more non-defaults than defaults).  \n\n💡 *Insight:*  \nOur data leans heavily on the right side — just like income distribution in real life!  \nWe’ll handle this skewness in preprocessing to prevent models from getting biased toward common low-value ranges.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Categorical

📊 **Observations from Bivariate Analysis**\n\n#### 🔹 Numeric Features vs Loan Status\n\n- **Loan Amount:** Non-defaulters have a slightly **higher average loan amount (~335K)** than defaulters (~319K), but the difference isn’t huge — indicating loan size alone doesn’t drive default strongly.  \n- **Rate of Interest:** The **average interest rate for defaulters (4.35%)** is higher than for non-defaulters (4.04%), suggesting that riskier borrowers are charged more interest — and are more likely to default.  \n- **Interest Rate Spread:** Data is mostly missing for defaulters, making it hard to compare, but higher spreads typically indicate riskier loans.  \n- **Upfront Charges:** Defaulters pay **lower upfront charges (avg ≈ 1.5K)** compared to non-defaulters (≈ 3.2K), possibly due to smaller or subsidized loans.  \n- **Property Value:** Defaulters own **less valuable properties (avg ≈ 457K)** than non-defaulters (≈ 505K), hinting at weaker financial backgrounds.  \n- **Income:** Defaulters earn less (≈ 6.2K) than non-defaulters (≈ 7.2K), which directly correlates with repayment capacity.  \n- **Credit Score:** Interestingly, both groups have similar average credit scores (~700), but variability might hide riskier subgroups.  \n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Defaulters have slightly **higher LTV ratios (76.3%)** compared to non-defaulters (72.0%), meaning they borrow more relative to property value — a risk factor for default.  \n- **DTIR (Debt-to-Income Ratio):** Defaulters have a **higher average DTIR (≈ 39.6)** than non-defaulters (≈ 37.3), showing that more indebted borrowers tend to default.\n\n---\n\n#### 🔹 Categorical Features vs Loan Status\n\n- **Loan Limit:** Majority are **conforming (cf)** loans, with slightly fewer defaults — non-conforming loans (ncf) show higher risk.  \n- **Gender:** **Male** and **Joint** applicants dominate, but **Sex Not Available** category has a surprisingly high proportion of defaults — possible data quality or demographic pattern.  \n- **Approval in Advance:** Borrowers with **pre-approved loans (pre)** default less — early screening clearly helps reduce risk.  \n- **Loan Type:** **Type1** loans (possibly standard loans) perform better, while **Type2/Type3** loans default more often.  \n- **Loan Purpose:** **p3 and p4** (possibly refinancing or non-primary purposes) have more defaults than **p1 (primary)** loans.  \n- **Credit Worthiness:** As expected, borrowers marked as **“l2” (lower credit quality)** default at much higher rates.  \n- **Open Credit:** Those without open credit accounts (**nopc**) default more, indicating a lack of active credit history.  \n- **Business or Commercial Loans:** Business loans (**b/c**) have a significantly higher default rate than personal ones (**nob/c**).  \n- **Negative Amortization:** Loans with **negative amortization (neg_amm)** show higher defaults — deferred interest is risky.  \n- **Interest Only Loans:** Default rate is higher for **interest-only** loans compared to standard ones.  \n- **Lump Sum Payment:** Loans with **lump-sum payments (lpsm)** have more defaults — large end payments increase pressure.  \n- **Construction Type:** Very few **manufactured homes (mh)** exist, but all of them defaulted — a clear risk signal.  \n- **Occupancy Type:** **Investor (ir)** and **secondary (sr)** properties default more than **primary residences (pr)**.  \n- **Secured By:** **Land-secured loans** are few but all defaulted — less liquid security increases risk.  \n- **Total Units:** Multi-unit properties (**3U, 4U**) have slightly higher default rates compared to single-unit (**1U**) properties.  \n- **Credit Type:** Defaulters are more common among **EQUI** and **CIB** types — possibly lower credit bureau grades.  \n- **Co-applicant Credit Type:** Defaults are higher when the **co-applicant uses EXP** credit — a minor but consistent pattern.  \n- **Age:** Younger borrowers (**25–34**) and elderly (**>74**) show higher default rates — financial instability on both ends.  \n- **Submission of Application:** **Direct submissions (to_inst)** tend to perform better than **indirect (not_inst)** applications.  \n- **Region:** **South** and **North** regions dominate both volume and defaults, suggesting possible regional economic differences.  \n- **Security Type:** All **indirectly secured loans** defaulted — direct security offers better repayment confidence.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 **Key Insights**\n\n- Defaulters tend to have **lower income, lower property value, higher interest rate, and higher LTV** — all pointing toward higher financial risk.  \n- Riskier loan structures (**interest-only, lump-sum, or business loans**) are more likely to default.  \n- Pre-approval, better creditworthiness, and primary residence ownership **significantly reduce default probability**.  \n- Regional and demographic patterns suggest **socio-economic influences** in repayment behavior.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🔺 **Step 2.3: Multivariate Analysis — When the Variables Collide!**\n\nNow that we’ve explored each feature individually (Univariate) and

🧩 Correlation Matrix — Insights & Observations\n\n- **Loan Amount ↔ Property Value (0.73)** → Very strong positive correlation, meaning larger properties tend to have higher loan amounts.  \n- **Loan Amount ↔ Income (0.46)** → Moderate positive correlation, suggesting that applicants with higher income usually take larger loans.  \n- **Loan Amount ↔ Term (0.17)** → Slight positive correlation — higher loan amounts might slightly increase loan duration.  \n- **Loan Amount ↔ Interest Rate (-0.15)** → Weak negative correlation — larger loans tend to have slightly lower interest rates, possibly due to better credit terms for high-value customers.  \n\n- **Property Value ↔ Income (0.41)** → Strong positive correlation — higher income is linked to more expensive properties.  \n- **Property Value ↔ LTV (-0.21)** → Negative correlation — when property value increases, the loan-to-value ratio decreases, indicating lower lending risk.  \n\n- **Rate of Interest ↔ Interest Rate Spread (0.61)** → Strong positive correlation, which makes sense since both metrics reflect lending cost structures.  \n- **Interest Rate Spread ↔ Loan Amount (-0.37)** → Negative correlation — larger loans tend to have smaller spreads, likely due to better-negotiated terms.  \n\n- **Income ↔ DTI Ratio (-0.26)** → Moderate negative correlation — higher-income applicants have lower debt-to-income ratios, implying better financial stability.  \n- **LTV ↔ DTI Ratio (0.16)** → Positive correlation — higher LTV loans are associated with slightly higher debt burdens.  \n\n- **Credit Score ↔ Rate of Interest (-0.00)** → Almost zero correlation — credit scores have minimal linear influence on interest rates in this dataset.  \n- **Credit Score ↔ Loan Amount (0.00)** → No significant correlation — loan amounts aren’t directly tied to credit scores.  \n\n- **Status (Target) ↔ DTI Ratio (0.08)** → Weak positive correlation — higher DTI ratios slightly increase default likelihood.  \n- **Status ↔ Loan Amount (-0.03)** and **Status ↔ Property Value (-0.04)** → Weak negative correlations — smaller loans and properties show a slightly higher risk of default.  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 Key Takeaway\nThe dataset shows meaningful relationships between **Loan Amount, Property Value, and Income**, forming the backbone of financial decision-making.  \nHowever, **Credit Score** and **Interest Rate** appear surprisingly weakly correlated — indicating that other factors might play a stronger role in determining loan status.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  **3.
